# KGar Dotfiles for Windows

Hello, I made a public repo for my dotfiles and Windows setup. If I'm being honest, this is a case where I'm starting this repo in hopes of coalescing my scattered configs and installs into some coherent, deployable dev environment. For a while, it's probably going to be pretty sparse...  

Update 1: I'm becoming increasingly interested in this after looking at some other setups out there. I'm not too particular about aliases and stuff for my terminals, but I do have software and command line tools that I always need on a new install. So, I'm back in the repo coalescing my various disparate dev machines' settings and symlinking the repo files to their respective places on the target machine.

# To Do

‚¨ú Backup any Git dotfiles that I frequently use (include noreply Git email) and make symlink script  
‚¨ú Backup and symlink my windows terminal config  
‚¨ú Figure out how to run a scheduled task 6 times a day to pull latest on the dotfiles-windows repo in C:  
‚¨ú Create a script that sets up the scheduled task during install.ps1 üî•üî•üî•  
‚¨ú Coalesce vs code settings from my work machine to the repo  
‚¨ú Set up work machine to get in on the setting sync  
‚¨ú Run scheduled task script on all owned machines with dev setups  
‚¨ú Make Choco install script for Visual Studio, with all my favorite options selected!  
‚¨ú Set up a scheduled task to get latest in the local copy of the dotfiles-windows repo  
‚¨ú Figure out a way to help me remember to commit dotfile repo changes when they occur  
‚¨ú Set up npm global installs  
‚¨ú ... 

# Questions
‚ùì Is it possible to automate setting windows theme preferences: desktop background, system sounds, and focus assist? Something that doesn't seem like it'll break the registry or break itself in 1 year?
